This is a repository for some of my past projects in data science.

-   [Imbalanced Classification on Bankruptcy Prediction](http://rpubs.com/songxh0424/336831): This project employs several techniques, including SMOTE sampling and ROC curve,

to tackle the inherent imbalance in bankruptcy data and builds machine learning models for bankruptcy prediction. Repeated cross-validation and alternative performance measures are used to evaluate models. Best models are selected based on cv ROC AUC values.

-   [Analyzing Movie Scores on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes](http://rpubs.com/songxh0424/336722): I love movies. I'm also intrigued by how movie websites rate movies and the fact

that their ratings on the same movie can be vastly different. This project uses data visualization in `ggplot2` to demonstrate IMDb and RT's different behaviors in reviewing movies. I also made some top 10 lists of directors, actors or movies based movie ratings. Computational tools used in this project include SparkSQL, Python and R.
